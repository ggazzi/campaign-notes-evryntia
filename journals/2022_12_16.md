	- General Idea
		- The story will follow the journey of a young knight named Phillipe von Eschenbach. His father is the Baron of Eschenbach and dies shortly before that start of the story.
		- The late Baron of Eschenbach is falsely accused of desertion by Duke Leopold. The king believes the accusation, removing the title of the late Baron and, therefore, Phillipe loses his inheritance.
		- Phillipe becomes an errant knight and struggles to support his wife and children. He fails even the simplest of tasks, despite being a competent fighter. This leads him and his living family to the brink of starvation.
		- In desperation, Phillipe seeks advice from the wise and eccentric sorceress Rowena. She tells him his sword has become cursed due to Phillipe's resentment and frustration of Duke Leopold.
		- Phillipe reluctantly disposes of his heirloom sword by throwing it into the Eschenbach river, which crosses his lands.
		- A few years later, Phillipe has become a successful knight, providing his living family with a certain stability. He still carries resentment for Duke Leopold, but could not find any proof of his deceit.
		- One day, Phillipe encounters Duke Leopold at a royal feast. Leopold publicaly scorns Phillipe for having a supposedly deserter as a father. Phillipe accuses the Duke of having deceived the king and challenges him to a duel to prove his father's innocence, with the king and his court as witnesses.
		- As the duel starts, the Duke reveals that he found Phillipe's discarded sword, using it in the duel to provoke Phillipe. Due to the curse, however, the Duke loses the duel and is killed by Phillipe.
		- Victorious, Phillipe recovers his heirloom sword, now broken in two. The king declares that, as God gave Phillipe the victory, the Duke must have been a liar. He restores Phillipe as the Baron of Eschenbach.
		- Phillipe wants to fix his sword, but no weaponsmith in the realm is able to do it. Desperate, he turns once more to Rowena. She tells him that the broken sword is a sign that Phillipe must leave his anger and vengeance behind, focusing instead on balance and justice for himself and for his subjects.
